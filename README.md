# Trashpath-mini-game


TrashPath is a 5x5 memory-based mini-game built on the Solana-based Gorbagana testnet.  
It challenges players to memorize a random tile sequence and retrace it â€” test your brain, degen-style.

##  How It Works

- The game has 3 levels:  
   - Level 1: 3 tiles  
   - Level 2: 5 tiles  
   - Level 3: 7 tiles  
- In each level, you'll see a glowing tile sequence.  
- Memorize it and click the tiles in the same order.  
- Pass all 3 levels correctly to win.  
- Only if you beat all 3 levels will you become eligible for testnet token rewards.  
- You can play in demo mode (no wallet required), or connect Backpack to qualify for rewards.


##  Gorbagana Integration

- Built on Gorbagana testnet
- Designed for fast on-chain games with instant feedback
- Backpack wallet supported (via wallet adapter)
- Native test token reward mechanism included (code-ready)
